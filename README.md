Linear Regression

This is one of the homeworks for the Artificial Intelligence class I took at UW-Madison in the fall of 2020. 

In this homework, I built a linear regression model for predicting the person's body fat based on certain bodily characteristics. I implemented MSE (Mean Squared Error), Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent functions for the model.
